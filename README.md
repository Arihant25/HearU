# HearU - Your AI Mental Health Companion ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

## Introduction

Welcome to HearU, where cutting-edge AI meets mental health support! ðŸš€ We've turbocharged our backend with the power of LLaMA, making our chat-based application smarter, more empathetic, and ready to lend an ear (or a text box) whenever you need it.

### Project Goals

1. Create a chat experience so smooth, you'll forget you're talking to an AI (but we'll remind you, because ethics).
2. Analyze your chats faster than you can say "How does that make you feel?" to provide insights that would make Freud jealous.

## System Design and Architecture

### Overview

Our app is like a digital sandwich of awesomeness:

- **The Bread (UI)**: A delicious, chat-based frontend that's easy on the eyes and the fingertips.
- **The Filling (Backend)**: A juicy combination of LLaMA-powered conversations and some seriously smart analysis.

### Data Flow

1. You chat, we listen (and analyze, but in a cool, non-creepy way).
2. Our AI figures out if you're talking about mental health or just really passionate about your sandwich.
3. If it's mental health-related, we categorize faster than you can say "anxiety."
4. We score the intensity because everything's more fun with points.
5. We whip up reports that show your emotional journey (like a mood ring, but actually accurate).

## Key Technologies

- **LLaMA Model**: Our new AI brain that's so smart, it makes JARVIS look like a calculator.
- **FastAPI**: Because our backend needs to be as fast as your mood swings.
- **SQLite**: Keeping your data snug and secure, like a digital blanket fort.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For when we need to crunch numbers faster than you can say "statistical analysis."
- **spaCy**: Our linguistic ninja, slicing and dicing text like a pro.
- **VADER Sentiment**: Because sometimes we need to know if your sentence is more Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker.

## Backend Magic âœ¨

Our backend is where the real party happens:

- **MentalHealthAnalyzer**: This bad boy can analyze text so fast, it'll make your head spin (but in a good way).
- **DatabaseManager**: Keeping your convos organized better than Marie Kondo.
- **LlamaManager**: Our AI conversationalist that's always ready for a chat, day or night.

## Conclusion

HearU isn't just an app; it's your personal mental health sidekick, powered by AI that's smart enough to understand you but not smart enough to judge your 3 AM ice cream choices.

## Future Scope

We're not stopping here! Our future plans are so exciting, they should come with a seatbelt:

1. **AI Therapist Bingo**: Recommending resources based on your chats (first one to get 'childhood trauma' wins!)
2. **Babel Fish for Emotions**: Translating your feelings into any language.
3. **Offline Mode**: For when you want to chat about your feelings in a Wi-Fi dead zone.

## Dataset Resources

We fed our AI a balanced diet of:

- Kaggle's finest mental health datasets
- A sprinkle of Google's emotional wisdom
- And a dash of peer-reviewed sentiment for that gourmet touch

Remember, HearU is here to listen, analyze, and maybe crack a joke or two (but only when appropriate). Let's make mental health conversations as normal as talking about the weather â€“ but way more interesting! ðŸŒˆðŸ§ ðŸ’–
